  <h1> Mini Site 2 - Training Zone</h1>
  <p>Drucilla Kelly; jc462562</p>
<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p>The new Training Zone website mission statement is to increase revenue for the company. This will be achieved through promoting the services offered by Training Zone, also increasing new and repeat clients. </p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
  <p> Sales received from advertising (not including the new website) have been consistent the last three months. We will measure the sales received over a three month period (after the website has been made live) and will compare this to previous sales. This will mean, any sales or client increase would be from the new website.</p>
  <h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience for Training Zone will be mature aged job seekers (between 28 and 50) that reside locally.  </p>
